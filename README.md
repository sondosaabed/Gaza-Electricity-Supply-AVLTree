For the past decade, the Gaza Strip has suffered from a chronic electricity deficit, which undermined already fragile living conditions. The situation has further deteriorated since April 2017 in the context of disputes between the de facto authorities in Gaza and the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. The ongoing power shortage has severely affected the availability of essential services, particularly health, water and sanitation services, and undermined Gazaâ€™s fragile economy, particularly the manufacturing and agriculture sectors.

The data presented in the attached file (Electricity.csv) is provided to OCHA on a daily basis by the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDCO), the official body in charge of electricity supply in the Gaza Strip. The variation in electricity demand per day is estimated based on the temperatures recorded on that day.

## AVL Trees

In this project, you will implement an Electricity data structure using combined AVL trees. The following figure shows the overall data structure:
